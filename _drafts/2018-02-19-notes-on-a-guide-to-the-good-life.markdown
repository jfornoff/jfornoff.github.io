This post will outline some of the core lessons I took from "A Guide to the Good Life" by William Irvine.

# Tranquility & Virtue

At the core of stoic philosophy stand the concepts of _Tranquility_ and _Virtue_.

**Tranquility** is described as the "psychological state marked by the *absence of negative emotions*", such as grief, anger or anxiety.
However, this is not a zombie-esque state of "not feeling anything", but instead the presence of positive emotions, untainted by negative ones.

Interestingly, Tranquility and Virtue are symbiotic. If you are not tranquil, your mind will be distracted by the negative emotions and
your judgement will be less reasonable. This in turn prevents you from moving towards Virtue. Your emotions triumph over your intellect.

# Adversities

Challenges and adversities in life are reframed into a sparring-like context.
If fate hits you hard, you should regard it as a type of training situation.

> Adversities we encounter in life are **mere training**. These things that we shudder and tremble at are **for the good** of the persons to whom they come.

We can observe how application of this thought changes emotional responses.
Instead of being frustrated and resenting an unfortunate event (note how these are all negative emotions), you shall view the broken Nutella jar and lost Love as an opportunity to practice your Virtue.

# Negative visualization

Contemplating bad things happening to you is powerful. Why?

Firstly, and less importantly, it helps you be mentally prepared if fate strikes.
However, the more interesting effect of imagining yourself getting fucked over in every imaginable fashion, is that you start appreciating not being fucked in these ways.

Let me elaborate.

Usually, things go a little like this: You have quite a lot of stuff. If you're reading this, I'm assuming that you at least have access to the internet. But you're pretty much used to it at this point. And chances are, you want something right now, would just love to have it! Nothing would make you happier.
Be it that slick new piece of tech gadget, that girl or boy next door looking so damn fine, a new pair of shoes.
And I'll be bold and state that after you get it, **you'll eventually lose your appreciation for it and it'll stop giving you joy.** This is natural, we adapt, even to what we have.

We are also dopamine junkies (the stuff in your brain that gives you that rush when you get something new).
When our appreciation wears off and we grow accustomed to the thing we just wanted so much, we eventually want something new to give us a new rush. *We start chasing the next thing.*

Stoics think that we can rejuvenate our passion for the things we already have by imagining losing them.
This does not mean getting pessimistic or even fatalistic. This means realizing that you're not entitled to have all these nice things.

> All we have is on loan from Fortune, which can reclaim it at any time, and without advance notice.

Re-learning to appreciate what we have can cut the cycle of wanting and chasing the next thing in pursuit of satisfaction short. It puts our first world problems into perspective.
