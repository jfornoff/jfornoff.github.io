This post will outline some of the core lessons I took from "A Guide to the Good Life" by William Irvine.

# Tranquility & Virtue

At the core of stoic philosophy stand the concepts of _Tranquility_ and _Virtue_.

**Tranquility** is described as the "psychological state marked by the *absence of negative emotions*", such as grief, anger or anxiety.
However, this is not a zombie-esque state of "not feeling anything", but instead the presence of positive emotions, untainted by negative ones.

Interestingly, Tranquility and Virtue are symbiotic. If you are not tranquil, your mind will be distracted by the negative emotions and
your judgement will be less reasonable. This in turn prevents you from moving towards Virtue. Your emotions triumph over your intellect.

# Adversities

Challenges and adversities in life are reframed into a sparring-like context.
If fate hits you hard, you should regard it as a type of training situation.

> Adversities we encounter in life are **mere training**. These things that we shudder and tremble at are **for the good** of the persons to whom they come.

We can observe how application of this thought changes emotional responses.
Instead of being frustrated and resenting an unfortunate event (note how these are all negative emotions), you shall view the broken Nutella jar and lost Love as an opportunity to practice your Virtue.
