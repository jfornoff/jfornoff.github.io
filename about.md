Hey. Prepare to be bored out of your mind.

Name is Jan, currently finishing up my **Masters Degree in Business Information Systems** at TU Darmstadt.
I've been writing software for quite some time, did 6ish years of Ruby working while studying.
Got into functional programming since it fits my approach to problem solving and seems to keep complexity at bay, mostly.
Currently I write a lot of **Elixir**.

Got a soft spot for **DevOps** and making things work really well when the rubber hits the road.
Also am sort of a **performance nerd** in that way, I love benchmarking and optimizing.

During my studies I touched a lot of networking technology and I'm really interested in **Distributed Systems**,
how they operate and thinking through the case where things go wrong.

Currently I'm working and learning alongside the great people of [**Grandcentrix**](https://www.grandcentrix.net/) part-time in addition to my studies.
